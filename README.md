The command is **/skywarssorter**

**The mod WILL crash if you dont have another mod with essential installed, I recommend yall to be using patcher**

Swords/axes look for the tier before replacing

(wood -> stone -> gold -> iron -> diamond)

Wooden axe will replace another wooden axe

Gold sword will not replace an iron sword

Currently the mod doesn't take into account enchants

(As far as I'm aware) This is not a cheat!!

I am using the vanilla number key functionality and everything is possible in vanilla
